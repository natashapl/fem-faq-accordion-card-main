- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For this project, I decided to try the bonus challenge and build the accordion with pure CSS. Although I've used CSS for years, I felt like a kid in class. It was fun to learn how to create states that would normally be done with javascript using only a checkbox and some CSS styles.

### Useful resources
